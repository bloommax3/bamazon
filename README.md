# Welcome to Bamazon

Hello and welcome to Bamazon. I, Max Bloom, created Bamazon as a class assignment for my Coding Bootcamp.

Bamazon has 3 different modes: Customer mode, Manager mode, and Supervisor mode. All three modes require the inquirer, mysql, and cli-table NPM packages.

As the customer, you can "buy" items from the available list by the product ID and select how many of that product you want. However, if you select an id not listed or an amount greater than the quantity in stock, you will not be able to buy the item.

As the manager, you can view products for sale, add new items to the inventory, view which items are running low, and increase your item quantity.

As the supervisor, you can see sales data and add departments.

Here is a video of me demonstrating how this all works: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cad1ML89NpmVaoo4zynKIq74PCMmjhhS/view
